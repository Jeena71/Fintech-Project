Fintech Project Management Data Challenge | Power BI Dashboard Insights

Excited to share my Power BI report built using a Fintech Project Management Dataset.
This dataset captures product development and delivery workflows for payment solutions like digital wallets, tap-to-pay systems, and payment APIs across multiple European regions.

📊 Dashboard Highlights (3 Pages): 1️⃣ Project Overview
✔ Tracked project status, progress, budgets, and completion %
✔ Identified projects delayed or at risk of overspending using day-difference analysis between planned and actual start dates
✔ Provided clear risk flags for proactive decision-making

2️⃣ Departments & Employees Overview
✔ Analyzed team distribution across Fintech Departments
✔ Compared hourly rates and experience levels to understand cost impact
✔ Measured resource-based efficiency using actual vs planned hours

3️⃣ Performance & Delivery Efficiency
✔ Connected milestones and task efficiency to overall project success
✔ Detected workflow bottlenecks like frequent ‘On Hold’ or ‘Review Required’ tasks
✔ Evaluated which departments and cities most consistently meet deadlines

🔍 Key Insights Identified:

Projects with higher early task overruns and larger day differences tend to show increased likelihood of delay & budget variance.

Senior & mid-level experience roles influence project cost with higher hourly rates, but also show better planning accuracy and task efficiency.

Certain cities and departments demonstrate stronger consistency in meeting deadlines, indicating mature workflows, while others show variance needing attention.
